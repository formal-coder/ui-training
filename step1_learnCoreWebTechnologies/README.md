Step 1: Learn Core Web Technologies (Week 1–2)

```
What You Will Learn:

· HTML Basics Understand how to use elements like headings, paragraphs, images, links, lists, tables, and forms. Learn how to apply attributes such as class, id, src, href, and alt.

· Semantic HTML5 Use meaningful tags like <header>, <nav>, <main>, <section>, <article>, <table> and <footer> to improve structure and accessibility.

· CSS Fundamentals Learn how to apply styles using selectors, understand the box model (content, padding, border, margin), and know how CSS specificity works.

· Layout Systems Use Flexbox and CSS Grid for layouts (rows + columns).

· Responsive Design Use media queries to create designs that adapt to different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).

explanation of the terms:
- **HTML Basics**: HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language for creating web pages. It uses elements to structure content, such as headings `(<h1> to <h6>), paragraphs (<p>), images (<img>), links (<a>), lists (<ul>, <ol>, <li>), tables (<table>, <tr>, <td>), and forms (<form>, <input>, <button>)`. Attributes like class, id, src, href, and alt provide additional information about these elements.</br></br>
- **Semantic HTML5**: Semantic HTML5 refers to using HTML elements that clearly describe their meaning in a human- and machine-readable way. For example, `using <header> for the top section of a page, <nav> for navigation links, <main> for the main content, <section> for thematic grouping, <article> for self-contained content, <table> for tabular data, and <footer> for the bottom section of a page`. This improves accessibility and SEO.</br></br>
- **CSS Fundamentals**: CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style HTML elements. It allows you to apply styles using selectors (e.g., element, class, id), understand the box model (which includes content, padding, border, and margin), and know how CSS specificity determines which styles are applied when multiple rules match the same element.</br></br>
- **Layout Systems**: Flexbox and CSS Grid are two powerful layout systems in CSS. Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional layouts (either rows or columns), allowing items to align and distribute space within a container. CSS Grid is used for two-dimensional layouts (both rows and columns), enabling complex grid-based designs.</br></br>
- **Responsive Design**: Responsive design is the practice of creating web pages that adapt to different screen sizes and orientations. Media queries in CSS allow you to apply different styles based on the device's characteristics, such as width, height, and resolution, ensuring a good user experience across mobile phones, tablets, and desktops.</br></br>
